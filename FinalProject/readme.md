# Project Proposal

### Introduction
#### Research Question: How is law-enforcing surveillance technology implemented in today's world?

The concept of surveillance seems to be an enticing topic by nature â€“ humans are easily interested in knowing how they are being watched. Surveillance technology implemented by governmental agencies can be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it helps departments like the police greatly in increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in resolving crimes and protecting other citizens; on the other hand, its presence constantly incites discussions and concerns for privacy. I am really interested in learning how surveillance technologies were adopted in the context of law enforcement in these years in the United States. What are the popular surveillance technologies used? What are the primary context in which they are used? What are their effectiveness and drawback?

This topic is tied to both sides, the implementers and the ones surveillance is implemented upon, who are the majority of people living in the U.S. Through exploring datasets with analyses and visualizations, this project could suggest how surveillance technologies were implemented and whether it has been an effective means for regulation. This could potentially give insight into issues like whether the benefit of surveillance technology outweighs the privacy concerns, or vice versa.

### Data Sources
The main dataset I will be using for this project is the [Atlas of Surveillance dataset](https://atlasofsurveillance.org/), which holds information on surveillance technologies deployed by law enforcement in communities across the United States. The dataset includes instances of the adoption of various surveillance technology by law enforcement agencies. I might also use supplemental datasets to dig deeper into various kinds of surveillance methods, such as using drones or face recognition technology. For example, the [Who Has Your Face?](https://whohasyourface.org/) dataset provides information on which governmental agencies can access face recognition images, which is helpful in understanding how these agencies use this surveillance technology and the accessibities to these privacy-concerning databases.

### Scope
In the analysis portion of the project, I will explore the variety of Law Enforcement Administration and Organizations (LEA) that use surveillance technologies, the variety of types of surveillance technologies used in different agencies, how many of the law enforcement agencies of each state has implemented surveillance technologies, etc. Moreover, I will explore how surveillance technologies are used in different law enforcement contexts. For example, I would examine how a surveillance technology, such as face recognition, is used for criminological versus administrative purposes. I will use a variety of visualizations to visualize the outcome of the datasets, such as bar plots, histograms, scatterplots, pie charts, maps. etc. An example would be to visualize the type of surveillance technology implemented categorized by the type of LEA. Another instance would be to visualize the use of a surveillance technology regionally across the country.

### Conclusion
By the end of this project, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how surveillance technologies are used today in the context of law enforcement. Surveillance is an evolving and convoluted topic in the modern era, as technological development is happening at an increasingly rapid speed. Questions arise along with the advancements: where to draw the line between protection and privacy? This could allow us to gain insight into the effectiveness of law-enforcing surveillance, and hence, to gain an idea of how to best protect citizens living in this society.
